# CodeWorks Student Workbook

> Welcome, we are excited to have you join us on your journey of becoming a Software Developer!

This project has been designed to help you gain an advantage in your learning and more importantly your career placement! The CodeWorks Student Workbook will provide a great starter and easy structure for your dev blog.

A large driving force for developer education world wide is simply writting your thoughts, reflections, struggles, and successes or in other words journaling. Maintaining a professional journal can heavily influence an employers decision to hire you over any other canidate. Sharing your knowledge through journaling with others will make you a better developer and may someday provide just the right type of encouragment for someone else to conquer and overcome their own struggles.  

Remember to keep your posts professional and truthful.

## Getting Started

To deploy your new blog please follow the instructions found here [Getting Started](./setup-instructions/readme.md)


## Adding a blog post

To add a new blog post create a `markdown` file (***.md***) in any of the week folders found in `src -> reflections -> wk`

Files in the week folders are automatically loaded so to maintain order in your blog posts filenames should match the following format `01-topic.md`. These markdown files will be loaded in the sidebar of your blog and will have the name of the `h1` or `# title` listed. If a heading is not the first line of the markdown file the file name will appear in the sidebar. 


___basic markdown guide___
```markdown
# Every file starts with a heading

## Subheadings are searchable

some plain text and a link: [CodeWorks Academy](https://codeworksacademy.com)

a line break uses three hyphens
